This will create a set of nested files, to give the Intention Repeater more power.

1000X1000.ZIP = 1,000 files x 1,000 intentions per file.
1000X10000.ZIP = 1,000 files x 1,0000 intentions per file.

You can use these files in the repeater, by putting the filename as the intention to repeat.
Be sure to have your intentions in the INTENTIONS.TXT file.

Repeater_Nesting_Utility.cpp = Source code for latest version of this utility.
Repeater_Nesting_Utility.exe = Windows binary.

You can run by double clicking on the .exe.

It will create a file called NESTFILES.ZIP.
That is the file you put in the Intention Repeater. Make sure your intentions are in the INTENTIONS.TXT
file before running the Repeater.

I will walk you through an example run.

Note, there's a little bug where if you have small # of files like 10, you have to put
number of files to write at a time as one more than the # of files.

So if you are creating 10 nesting files, you need to write 11 files at a time.

Here's sample output: 

Archive into Zip? (y/N): y

How many nesting files to create: 10

How many repetitions in each file: 10000

How many files to write at a time: 11

Adding File # 0 / 10
Adding File # 1 / 10
Adding File # 2 / 10
Adding File # 3 / 10
Adding File # 4 / 10
Adding File # 5 / 10
Adding File # 6 / 10
Adding File # 7 / 10
Adding File # 8 / 10
Adding File # 9 / 10
Adding File # 10 / 10
Intention Repeater Nesting Files Written.

Be sure to have your intentions in the INTENTIONS.TXT file.

And use NESTFILES.ZIP in the Intention Repeater to utilize the full NEST stack.
